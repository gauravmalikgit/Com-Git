# 🚀 Upload Instructions for GitHub

## Quick Upload Process

The code is ready to be uploaded to your GitHub repository. I've prepared everything, but you'll need to complete the final steps since I don't have access to your GitHub credentials.

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Easiest)

1. **Download the project folder** to your local machine
2. **Visit your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/gauravmalikgit/AI-Push-Notification-Generator-.git
3. **Upload files directly**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or drag and drop the entire project folder
   - GitHub will handle the upload automatically

### Option 2: Git Command Line (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the pn-generator directory
cd /workspace/pn-generator

# 2. Configure Git with your credentials (if not already done)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# 3. Push to GitHub (the repository is already initialized)
git push -u origin main
```

If you get a permission error, you may need to:

#### For HTTPS Authentication:
```bash
# Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
# Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Create a token with 'repo' permissions
# Use the token as your password when prompted
```

#### For SSH Authentication:
```bash
# Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:gauravmalikgit/AI-Push-Notification-Generator-.git

# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Alternative Upload Method

If you're having trouble with git, you can:

1. **Create a ZIP file** of the entire `pn-generator` folder
2. **Download it** to your local machine
3. **Extract** the ZIP file
4. **Use GitHub Desktop** or your preferred Git client to upload
